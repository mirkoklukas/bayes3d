    "abstract: \"This notebook showcases an advanced modeling application of several Gen-specific ingredients. It combines combinator patterns for structured generative computation, with [the approximate density interface](https://github.com/probcomp/GenProx.jl) using variants of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) [constructed using a composable mini-language for SMC algorithms](../smc_language/smc_language). These ingredients come together to replicate [Feras Saad's 2019 experiments on Bayesian program synthesis for Gaussian process models](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290350) on the GPU.\"\n",
